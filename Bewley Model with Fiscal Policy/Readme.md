# Bewley Model With Fiscal Policy

Consider a simple economy with a continuum of households subject to idiosyncratic income shocks. They save in form of a liquid asset, which is supplied as government bonds. Correspondingly, the government taxes income to pay for the interest on those bonds

- **Problem of the Household**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\max_{\{c_{t}^{i},a_{t+1}^{i}\}} \mathbb{E}_{0} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{\rho t} u(c_{t}^{i}) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad  & da_{t}^{i}  = \left[ (1-\tau_{t})y_{t} + r_{t}a_{t}^{i} -c_{t}^{i} \right] dt\\
\text{and} \quad  & dy_{t}(y_{i}) = \sum_{j \neq i} (y_{j}-y_{i})dN_{t}^{j} \\
\text{and} \quad & a_{t+1}^{i} \geq \bar{a}
\end{aligned}
$$
