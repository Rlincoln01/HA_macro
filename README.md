## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of codes for solving and estimating Heterogenous agents economies. It features economies in discrete and continuous time, and the codes are useful for studying applications of numerical methods (Finite Difference, Value Function Iteration)

## Getting Started
In the following list, I detail the available folders with the models or calibration/simulation procedures they contain:

- One-Asset Aiyagari Economy:

- One-Asset Bewley Economy:
