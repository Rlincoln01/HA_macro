## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of codes for solving and estimating Heterogenous agents economies. It features economies in discrete and continuous time, and the codes are useful for studying applications of numerical methods (Finite Difference, Value Function Iteration)

## Getting Started
In the following list, I detail the available folders with the models or calibration/simulation procedures they contain:

- One-Asset Aiyagari Economy:

- One-Asset Bewley Economy:

- Income Process Calibration: Contains a set of files for calibrating a Continuous-time income process with micro data using an adaptation of [(Guvenen et al. 2021)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6246570e617f1d3daf55e1c1/t/628e6309b2e01e636b2ee9b3/1653498634356/guvenen-karahan-ozkan-song-econometrica-2021.pdf) parallelizable global optimization routine with local search methods (Nelder Mead). A special thanks for Tomas [https://tomasrm.github.io/](https://tomasrm.github.io/) for providing his codes in Julia of his [paper on Trade Shocks and Higher-Order Earnings Risk in Local
Labor Markets](https://tomasrm.github.io/assets/files/MartinezMello_trade_risk.pdf), over which I adapted to Matlab
